* Conforguration

Use the power of [[http://orgmode.org/][Org]] to configure accounts and servers.

* How does it work?

Run ~M-x org-babel-tangle~ (=C-c C-v t=) on [[file:conforguration.org][conforguration.org]] to generate installation scripts in the ~conforguration_scripts/~ and ~dotfiles/~ directories.

** Dotfiles

Raw dotfiles are in ~dotfiles/~. Because they start with a dot (e.g. ~.bashrc~) they are not visible to ~ls~ normally, so use ~ls -a~ to see them.

Dotfiles are copied to ~$HOME/dotfiles/~ and symlinks are made from your home directory to there.

** Installing applications and packages

Sync the scripts to remote servers, then run the scripts on those remote servers.

The nice things about this is that either locally or remotely, you can use ~C-c C-c~ on the shell blocks to execute them, or you can run the scripts at the command line.

* Why?

Because [[https://www.ansible.com/][Ansible]] and similar configuration management tools aren't done in Org.

* What next?

I don't know, but if you're interested, have at it.

There is a lot of duplication.  Perhaps there is a nice way to tidy that up.

* License

GPL v3.  See COPYING for details.
