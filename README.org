* Conforguration

Use the power of [[http://orgmode.org/][Org]] to configure accounts and servers.

* How does it work?

Run ~M-x org-babel-tangle~ on [[file:conforguration.org][conforguration.org]] to generate shell scripts in the ~scripts/~ directory.  Sync the scripts to remote servers, then run the scripts on those remote servers.

The nice things about this is that either locally or remotely, you can use ~C-c C-c~ on the shell blocks to execute them, or you can run the scripts at the command line.

* Why?

Because [[https://www.ansible.com/][Ansible]] and similar configuration management tools aren't done in Org.

* What next?

I don't know, but if you're interested, have at it.

* License

GPL v3.  See COPYING for details.
